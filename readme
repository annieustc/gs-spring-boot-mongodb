Spring Boot + Accessing Data with MongoDB

------------ Install and launch MongoDB
With your project set up, you can install and launch the MongoDB database.

If you are using a Mac with homebrew, this is as simple as:

$ brew install mongodb
With MacPorts:

$ port install mongodb
For other systems with package management, such as Redhat, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and Windows, see instructions at http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/.

After you install MongoDB, launch it in a console window. This command also starts up a server process.

$ mongod
You probably wonâ€™t see much more than this:

all output going to: /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log


------------ mongodb
1) install mongodb 
2) start mongodb cd /Users/bnb/mongodb/bin <Bin's local PC> $ ./mongod 
3) create database "contract" $ ./mongo 
> use contract 
4) create collections > db.createCollection("message") 
5) query collection > db.order.find({});

------------ to run the application
$mvn clean

$mvn package && java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-mongodb-0.1.0.jar	

As our Application implements CommandLineRunner, the run method is invoked automatically when boot starts. You should see something like this (with other stuff like queries as well):

== Customers found with findAll():
Customer[id=51df1b0a3004cb49c50210f8, firstName='Alice', lastName='Smith']
Customer[id=51df1b0a3004cb49c50210f9, firstName='Bob', lastName='Smith']

== Customer found with findByFirstName('Alice'):
Customer[id=51df1b0a3004cb49c50210f8, firstName='Alice', lastName='Smith']
== Customers found with findByLastName('Smith'):
Customer[id=51df1b0a3004cb49c50210f8, firstName='Alice', lastName='Smith']
Customer[id=51df1b0a3004cb49c50210f9, firstName='Bob', lastName='Smith']
